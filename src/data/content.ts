  narrative: `I'm a computer scientist with a focus on data engineering, infrastructure, and security. My work centers on building reliable data pipelines, analyzing complex data patterns, and ensuring system integrity at scale. I design ETL workflows that transform raw data into actionable insights while maintaining security and reliability standards.

I approach problems with an infrastructure-first mindset—thinking about data quality, system scalability, and security from the ground up. Whether it's building data processing pipelines, monitoring telecommunications networks, or implementing data validation workflows, I'm passionate about creating robust technical solutions that combine data engineering practices with security awareness and analytical rigor.`,
  philosophy: "Data pipelines are critical infrastructure. My role is to build systems that are secure, scalable, and reliable—transforming raw data into organizational intelligence while maintaining integrity every step of the way.",
