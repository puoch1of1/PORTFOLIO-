  narrative: `I'm a data engineer driven by the challenge of building reliable data infrastructure at scale. My work focuses on designing and implementing ETL pipelines, optimizing data flows, and creating scalable systems that turn raw, chaotic data into structured, actionable insights.

I approach data engineering with an infrastructure-first mindset—thinking about data quality, pipeline reliability, and system scalability from the ground up. Whether it's building batch processing workflows, implementing real-time data streams, or ensuring data integrity across distributed systems, I'm passionate about creating the foundational data pipelines that power organizational decision-making.`,
  philosophy: "Data pipelines are the nervous system of modern organizations. My role is to build infrastructure that's not just functional, but resilient, scalable, and maintainable—transforming chaos into clarity.",
