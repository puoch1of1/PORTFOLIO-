  narrative: `I'm a computer scientist driven by curiosity and discipline, with a deep interest in systems, networks, and data. My work focuses on understanding infrastructure—how systems connect, how data flows, and how we can build more secure and intelligent solutions.

I approach problems with an infrastructure-first mindset, thinking about reliability, scalability, and security from the ground up. Whether it's monitoring telecommunications networks, analyzing data patterns, or securing systems, I'm interested in the fundamentals that make technology work reliably at scale.`,
